# bp-page
blackpink webpage utilising go, html and css

done for practice, used tutorials to get there.

goals:
- familiarising myself with html and css again
- learning how to make local web servers in go
- implementing html pages in such servers (as well as css stylesheets)

commented code involves creating forms in html, implementing them and simple web security measures. couldn't get it to work with my stylesheet, will have a look at it
