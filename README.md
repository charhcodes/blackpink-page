# bp-page
blackpink webpage utilising go, html and css

done for practice, used tutorials to get here:
- familiarising myself with html and css again
- making simple web servers in go
- implementing html pages in such server (as well as a css stylesheet)

commented code involves creating forms in html, implementing them and simple web security measures. couldn't get it to work with my stylesheet, will have a look at it
